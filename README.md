# Lab 2: Tic Tac Toe

## Homework instructions

1. Have the game reset and allow the player to play again.
2. Keep track of who won and at the end of a game session, give the player's stats, the bot's stats and stats on draws. (Can be numbers or %)
3. Write documentation that shows me you understood what every method does and how it does so.
4. Test your own code with multiple scenarios to prevent divide-by-zero, and other errors. I will penalize missed cases (within reason) as we have implemented this functionality in the rest of the program.
5. Complete [WriteUp.md](WriteUp.md).
